# Weyn's Paks

Here is a collection of all of the mesh swapped Default Skin paks I've been making recently. Basically free skins for different Fortnite builds, If you would like to see one that's not in the repository, feel free to dm me at weyn#1773.

Instructions: Download the .pak file in the folder of the skin you want. Next, drag that .pak file into your FortniteGame\Content\Paks folder. Then, copy a .sig file and rename it to the exact name of the pak file but with .sig at the end instead of .pak. Then, Just load up Fortnite and you should be able to use it in game!

Exclusion: Not all skins works in RiftMP or FortMP, but they all work in singleplayer. Also not every skin animation such as hair or stuff like that works 100%, e.g. Ariana Grande, Nothing can be done to fix that.

With thaat being said, Make sure to Credit me if you're gonna repost them anywhere & have fun using them paks :D
